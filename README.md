Hi,
 
I'm an entry Data Scientist and Software Developer with Python expertise.

I fetch, prepare, analyse, visualize, and perform automations on various kinds of data using Python interfaces for Mathematics (numpy), Data Analysis (pandas), Statistics (statsmodels), and Machine Learning (scikit-learn, tensor flow, and keras).

On the other hand, I do System administration, GUI programming (with tkinter), and some Web development (with django and/or cgi scripting).

I'm mostly a self taught software developer and currently learning Machine Learning and Cryptography.

I'm well determined in my expertise and maintain great communication, organizational, time management, decision making, and prioritization skills.
